  <h2>Measurement</h2>
  <p>Appropriate apparatus must be used when measuring time, temperature, mass, and volume.</p>
  <h3>Volume</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Measuring cylinders measure medium volumes accurately</li>
    <li>Burettes have taps and can measure medium volumes even more accurately</li>
    <li>Pipettes are used to release drops of a liquid and are not good for measuring</li>
    <li>Graduated pipettes have lines on them and can measure small volumes accurately</li>
  </ul>
