  <h1>Inheritance</h1>
  <p>Inheritance is the transmission of genetic information from generation to generation.</p>
  <h2>Chromosomes and Genes</h2>

  </DataTable>
  <h3>Chromosomes</h3>
  <p>These bundles of DNA are found in the <strong>nucleus</strong>.</p>
  <h3>Human Cells</h3>
  <p>The chromosomes in all diploid cells are arranged in pairs. However, different species will have a different number of chromosomes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Human diploid cells have <strong>23 pairs</strong> of chromosomes (46 in total)</li>
    <li>Human gamets are haploid and only have <strong>23 unpaired</strong> chromosomes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Cell Division</h2>
  <h3>Mitosis</h3>
  <p>This is a type of nuclear division that produces <strong>genetically identical</strong> cells.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The duplication of chromosomes occurs <strong>before</strong> mitosis</li>
    <li>
      Mitosis plays a vital role in:
      <ul>
        <li>growth</li>
        <li>repair of damaged tissue</li>
        <li>replacement of cells</li>
        <li>asexual reproduction</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Meiosis</h3>
  <p>This type of nuclear division is also called reduction division because the chromosome number is <strong>halved</strong> from diploid to <strong>haploid</strong>, resulting in genetically different cells.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Meiosis is involved in the production gametes such as:
      <ul>
        <li>sperm (male)</li>
        <li>egg (female)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Punnett Squares</h3>
  <p>Punnet squares are used to show the possible genotypes of a single offspring after sexual reproduction.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dominant alleles are usually represented with an uppercase letter</li>
    <li>Recessive alleles are usually represented with a lowercase letter</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are a maximum of 3 possible genotypes in a simple Punnet square (ignoring co-dominance).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Homozygous Dominant</li>
    <li>Homozygous Recessive</li>
    <li>Heterozygous</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Only parents with the same pair of <strong>homozygous</strong> alleles can ensure <strong>pure-breeding</strong>.</p>
  <Punnett mother="TT" father="TT" label="100% Dominant"></Punnett>
  <Punnett mother="tt" father="tt" label="100% Recessive"></Punnett>
  <p>Parents with heterozygous alleles will have the most variation.</p>
  <Punnett mother="Ff" father="Ff" label="25% Dominant, 50% Heterozygous, 25% Recessive"></Punnett>
  <p>Gender is controlled by a dominant gene in the Y chromosome and a recessive gene in the X chromosome. Only males have a Y chromosome.</p>
  <Punnett mother="XX" father="XY" label="50% Heterozygous, 50% Recessive"></Punnett>

  <h3>Variation</h3>
  <p>There are 2 types of variation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Phenotypic</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Genes & Environment</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Continuous</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Genotypic</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Genes</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Discontinuous</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The possible phenotypes resulting from variation can be grouped into 2 categories.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Continuous</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>When a <strong>range of phenotypes</strong> can be expressed</li>
        <li>Caused by both genes and the environment</li>
        <li>Continuous data like <strong>height in humans</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Discontinuous</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>When only a <strong>limited number of phenotypes</strong> can be expressed</li>
        <li>Caused by genes alone</li>
        <li>Discrete data like <strong>blood group</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="notes">
      Cystic fibrosis is an example of discontinuous variation because it has a <strong>limited number of phenotypes</strong> and is <strong>caused by genes alone</strong>.
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Mutations</h3>
  <p>Ionising radiation and some chemicals can increase the rate of mutation. Mutations allow organisms that produce asexually to develop new traits. For example, antibiotic resistance is caused by mutations in bacteria.</p>
  <h3>Selection</h3>
  <h4>Natural Selection</h4>
  <p>Natural selection takes place without human intervention.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Lots of variation within populations</li>
    <li>Production of many offspring</li>
    <li>Increase in population increases competition for resources</li>
    <li>Many individuals struggle for survival</li>
    <li>Individuals that are better adapted to the environment reproduce</li>
    <li>Advantageous alleles are passed down to the next generation</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The development of strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria is an example of evolution by natural selection.</p>
  <h4>Artificial Selection</h4>
  <p>Traits and characteristics are selected by humans during artificial selection.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Humans select individuals with desirable features</li>
    <li>These individuals get crossed to produce the next generation</li>
    <li>Offspring showing desirable features selected</li>
  </ol>
