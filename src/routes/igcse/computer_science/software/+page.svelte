  <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
  <h3>High-Level</h3>
  <p>A high-level language uses natural language as syntax and is designed to make writing code easier for programmers. Examples of high level langauges include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Visual Basic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>High-level languages are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>easier to understand</li>
    <li>easier to debug</li>
    <li>portable</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These advantages allow programmers to focus on the problem instead of managing memory and harware.</p>

    Easy debuggig allows programmers to fix errors quickly and avoid mistakes. Portable means the program can run on any computer and there is no need to understand hardware.
  </Callout>
  <h3>Low-Level</h3>
  <p>A low-level language communicates with the computer hardware directly and is harder to understand. Assembly and machine code are examples of low-level languages.</p>
  <h4>Assembly</h4>
  <p>Assembly code uses mnemonics such as <code>LDA</code> and <code>ADD</code> to represent binary instructions.</p>
  <h4>Machine Code</h4>
  <p>Machine code is a list of instructions written in <strong>binary</strong>. Computers can only understand binary. This means that every programming language has to eventually be converted into machine code.</p>
  <h2>Translators</h2>
  <p>A translator converts source code written in a high-level or low-level language into machine code.</p>
  <p>There are 3 types of translators:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>assemblers</li>
    <li>compilers</li>
    <li>interpreters</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Assemblers</h3>
  <p>An assembler translates low-level assembly code into machine code.</p>
  <h3>Compilers</h3>
  <p>A compiler translates a whole source code file into machine code in one go. It also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>checks for errors <strong>before</strong> running the program</li>
    <li>generates a report of <strong>all the errors</strong> found in the program</li>
    <li>produces an executable file</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Interpreters</h3>
  <p>An interpreter translates source code one line after the other. It also:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>translates one line of source code into machine code and runs it <strong>before</strong> moving on to the next line</li>
    <li>stops when it encounters an error</li>
    <li>allows errors to be fixed in real-time</li>
  </ul>
