  <h1>Thermal Physics</h1>
  <h2>The Kinetic Molecular Model</h2>
  <p>The simple kinetic molecular model of matter is used to describe the thermodynamic interactions betweens solids, liquids, and gases.</p>
  <h3>States of Matter</h3>
  <p>There are 3 states of matter (excluding plasma) with distinct properties. These states of matter can be distinguished by the forces, distances, and motion of the molecules.</p>
  <DataTable>
    <Head>
      <Row>
        <Cell>State</Cell>
        <Cell>Forces</Cell>
        <Cell>Distances</Cell>
        <Cell>Motion</Cell>
      </Row>
    </Head>
    <Body>
      {#each a as row}
        <Row>
          {#each row as cell}
            <Cell>{cell}</Cell>
          {/each}
        </Row>
      {/each}
    </Body>
  </DataTable>
  <h3>Changing State of Matter</h3>
  <p>Melting, boiling and sublimation absorb thermal energy from the environment while freezing, condensation, and deposition release thermal energy into the environment. The <strong>temperature does not change</strong> during melting and boiling because the energy is being used to break the bonds between the particles.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Melting: Solid to Liquid</li>
    <li>Freezing: Liquid to Solid</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Boiling: Liquid to Gas</li>
    <li>Condensation: Gas to Liquid</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Sublimation: Solid to Gas</li>
    <li>Deposition: Gas to Liquid</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Evaporation</h3>
  <p>During evaporation, the most energetic molecules leave the surface of the liquid. This results in the cooling of the liquid because the <strong>average kinetic energy</strong> of the remaining particles decreases.</p>
  <p>The rate of evaporation can be increased by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>temperature</li>
    <li>surface area</li>
    <li>wind speed</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Evaporation and Boiling</h4>
  <p>Boiling occurs throughout a liquid while evaporation occurs on the surface of a liquid. Unlike evaporation, boiling can only take place when the temperature reaches the boiling point or range of the substance.</p>

        </Row>
      {/each}
    </Body>
  </DataTable>
  <h4>Sweating</h4>
  <p>Sweating cools down the body due to evaporation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Water in sweat evaporates</li>
    <li>Most energetic particles leave the surface of the skin</li>
    <li>The average kinetic energy of the remaining particles is reduced</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Pressure Changes</h2>
  <h2>Thermal Expansion</h2>
  <h2>Measuring Temperature</h2>
  <h2>Thermal Processes</h2>
  <p>Objects can transfer thermal energy in 3 ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conduction</li>
    <li>Convection</li>
    <li>Radiation</li>
  </ul>

      {#each c as row}
        <Row>
          {#each row as cell,i}
            <Cell>
              {#if i === 2}
                <span class="material-symbols-rounded" style="text-align: center; width: 100%;">{cell ? 'check' : 'close'}</span>
              {:else}
                {cell}
              {/if}
            </Cell>
          {/each}
        </Row>
      {/each}
    </Body>
  </DataTable>
  <h3>Conduction</h3>
  <p>Conduction can technically happen in any medium. However it is more common in solids than fluids.</p>
  <p>Conudction occurs when particles collide and transfer their kinetic energy.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Solids transfer thermal energy by vibrating</li>
    <li>Metals can also transfer thermal energy by colliding with electrons</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Convection</h3>
  <p>Convection is the main method of energy transfer in fluids. Heating fluids can cause convection currents.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Heated fluid <strong>expands</strong> and becomes <strong>less dense</strong></li>
    <li>Heated fluid rises</li>
    <li>Colder fluid sinks to replace the heated fluid</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The convection currents will cycle if the heat source is placed at the bottom of the fluid.</p>
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ¤”">
    Increasing the surface area of an object can increase the amount of heat lost by convection.
  </Callout>
  <p>Blankets are good at reducing heat lost by convection because they trap a layer of air. Air is a poor conductor of air.</p>
  <h3>Radiation</h3>
  <p>Thermal energy can travel as infrared waves. Infrared waves can <strong>travel in a vacuum</strong> unlike methods of thermal energy transfer.</p>
